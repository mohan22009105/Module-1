# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Minimum of Three Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the largest among three Integer Numbers ..

## ALGORITHM  
1. Start the program.

2. Prompt the user to input three integer numbers (a, b, and c).

3. Use if-elif-else to compare the three numbers:

   If a is greater than both b and c, then a is the largest.

   Else if b is greater than both a and c, then b is the largest.

   Else, c is the largest.

4. Display the largest number.

5. End the program.

## PROGRAM

Reg no: 212222220026

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
if a>b and a>c:
    print(f"The largest of the three a= {a} b= {b} c= {c} is {a}")
elif b>a and b>c:
    print(f"The largest of the three a= {a} b= {b} c= {c} is {b}")
else:
    print(f"The largest of the three a= {a} b= {b} c= {c} is {c}")

```
